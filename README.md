# zk-toolkit
Library built from scratch to implement zk-protocols.

## Goal
To build a zk library from scratch keeping the implementation as easily understadable as possible so that it can help people including myself who are studying zk technology understand lower level details of it.

## What's implemented so far
- Basic operators in field calculation (add, sub, mul, inv and etc)
- ECDSA add and scalar multiplication
