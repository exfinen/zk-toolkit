# zk-toolkit
Library built from scratch to implement zk-protocols.

## Goal
To build a zk library from scratch keeping the implementation as easily understadable as possible so that it can help people including myself who are studying zk technology understand lower level details of it.

## What's implemented so far
- Basic operations in field calculation (add, sub, mul, inv, pow, sq)
- Weierstrass type elliptic curve add and scalar mul operations in affine/jacobian coordinates
- ECDSA sign and verify
- SHA256 hasher

## What's NOT implemented so far
- Big number
- Random number generator
